Cases used for exercises during the [Responsible Research Data Management course](https://www.egsh.eur.nl/doctoral-education/phd-course-guide/responsible-research-data-management-rdm/) at the Erasmus Graduate School for Social Sciences and the Humanities (EGSH). 

## Case 1: Intergroup conflict from a macro-level and micro-level perspective

**Tom’s PhD project** is part of a European grant that investigates intergroup conflict from a macro-level and micro-level perspective.  
The PhD student will carry out behavioral experiments using multi-round economic games. In addition, he will study armed conflicts in modern history using the [UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset](https://www.prio.org/data/4). Finally, he will do qualitative analysis of interviews that are part of the [Interviewproject Nederlandse Veteranen - IPNV](https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-xhc-dxzk), a collection of over 900 interviews with Dutch veterans 1940-now from the Netherlands Veterans Institute (available in DANS Easy under restricted access).  
Case loosely based on this ERC grant: [https://doi.org/10.3030/785635](https://doi.org/10.3030/785635)

## Case 2: Political polarization

**Sarah’s PhD project** on political polarization. She conducts focus groups with political youth party members, focusing on right- and left-wing parties in different countries. Sessions are videotaped. This is a collaboration with researchers from Universities in Poland, France, Greece.  
She also conducts ethnographic fieldwork in two different communities where she focuses on political engagement.  
Finally, she will do a quantitative analysis of health and economic determinants of voting behavior using [CBS Microdata](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/our-services/customised-services-microdata/microdata-conducting-your-own-research) and the [LISS panel](https://www.centerdata.nl/en/liss-panel).
